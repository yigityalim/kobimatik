# Next.js SaaS Starter


<details>
  <summary>Why did I make this?</summary>

In 2020, I made a course called "React 2025" which showed how to build a SaaS application with Next.js, Stripe, and other tools.

Well, it's almost 2025 and React 19 has brought so many amazing new features I didn't predict! This repo is a demonstration of the latest React and Next.js patterns. These patterns can drastically simplify some common tasks in building your SaaS, like building forms, talking to your database, and more.

For example, React now has built in hooks like `useActionState` to handle inline form errors and pending states. React Server Actions can replace a lot of boilerplate code needed to call an API Route from the client-side. And finally, the React `use` hook combined with Next.js makes it incredibly easy to build a powerful `useUser()` hook.

We're able to fetch the user from our Postgres database in the root layout, but _not_ await the `Promise`. Instead, we forward the `Promise` to a React context provider, where we can "unwrap" it and awaited the streamed in data. This means we can have the best of both worlds: easy code to fetch data from our database (e.g. `getUser()`) and a React hook we can use in Client Components (e.g. `useUser()`).

Fun fact: the majority of the UI for this application was built with [v0](https://v0.dev) ðŸ¤¯ [More details here](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1835777934361084316) if you want to learn about this repo.

## Features

- Dashboard pages with CRUD operations on users/teams
- Basic RBAC with Owner and Member roles
- Subscription management with Stripe Customer Portal
- Email/password authentication with JWTs stored to cookies
- Global middleware to protect logged-in routes
- Local middleware to protect Server Actions or validate Zod schemas
- Activity logging system for any user events

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **UI Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Running Locally

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Then, run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can, of course, create new users as well through `/sign-up`.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Going to Production

When you're ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to Vercel and deploy it.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process, which will guide you through setting up your project.

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings (or during deployment), add all the necessary environment variables. Make sure to update the values for the production environment, including:

1. `BASE_URL`: Set this to your production domain.
2. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Use your Stripe secret key for the production environment.
3. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Use the webhook secret from the production webhook you created in step 1.
4. `POSTGRES_URL`: Set this to your production database URL.
5. `AUTH_SECRET`: Set this to a random string. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate one.
